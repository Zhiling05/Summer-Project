### What Went Well
- Actively engage with the client to confirm requirements and keep information flowing.
- Make real-time adjustments based on client feedback.
- Maintain timely, transparent communication and close intra-team collaboration.
- Set clear weekly goals and execute plans efficiently.
- Proficiently use GitHub and Overleaf for collaborative work.

### What Didn’t Go Well
- Too many different office-software tools are in use, so coordination is needed.
- Team members have varying levels of understanding of the overall workflow, making alignment in meetings difficult.
- Only the same few people speak up actively in meetings, indicating others may not have fully digested the information on their own.
- Deliverables are rushed to completion on the last day of the deadline, leaving no time for other members to review them.

### Challenges & Blockers
- Documentation is scattered across multiple locations, with no unified management system.
- Building the logical decision tree is challenging because the medical workflow is complex and must be extremely rigorous.
- Team members lack a medical background, making the content difficult to understand.

### Action Items
- 16.07–23.07： Complete doctor and patient logic; build shared UI layout; complete first report draft; iterative update of application.  
- 24.07–15.08： Conduct user testing; integrate feedback; finalise multi-role logic and documentation.

### Sprint Sentiment
- Overall：4.44（Efficiency：4.28；Collaboration：4.51；Output：4.54）  
- Anonymous ratings (out of 5) averaged 4.28 (Efficiency), 4.51 (Collaboration), 4.54 (Output)—an overall 4.44. The team is happy with collaboration and results, but the lower efficiency score shows workflow gaps still need tightening.
