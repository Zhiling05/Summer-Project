1. As an optometrist, I want the system to clearly display diagnostic pathways without requiring internet connection, so I can rely on it for decision-making in community clinics or remote practice settings.  

2. I want the tool to highlight specific "red flag" symptoms (e.g., sudden vision loss, severe headache) to indicate when immediate referral is mandatory.  

3. As an optometrist, I want to return to previous steps in the decision guide to review or modify inputs when necessary.  

4. I want the tool to provide concise explanations of professional terms (e.g., PHOMS, drusen) to support informed decisions even when unfamiliar with certain examination findings.  

5. As an optometrist, I want the software to retain partially completed questionnaires when re-entering, allowing me to continue interrupted work due to clinical demands.  

6. As an optometrist with age-related or impaired vision, I want adjustable font sizes for better readability during data entry.  

7. As a first-time user, I want clear tutorials to quickly understand workflows and use the tool correctly.  

8. As an experienced user, I want the option to skip tutorials for direct access to the operational interface.  

9. As a functionality-focused optometrist, I want an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and minimalist to maintain clinical focus without operational distractions.  

10. As an optometrist, I want to export referral recommendations with patient symptoms as downloadable PDFs for documented referral justification.  

11. As an optometrist, I want color-coded tags (red/yellow/green) to categorize patient assessments by urgency for efficient retrospective review.  

12. As an optometrist, I want confirmation prompts after submitting diagnostic workflows to verify completion before starting new cases.  

13. As a junior optometrist, I want simplified referral rationale displays to better explain needs to patients and improve compliance/trust.  

14. As a novice optometrist, I want an "exit current test" button to restart assessments after accidental inputs.  

15. As an optometrist, I want to save assessment progress and exit workflows at any time for better work scheduling.  

16. As a frequent mobile user, I want an eye-care mode for comfortable use in low-light or nighttime environments.  

17. As an optometrist frequently encountering optic disc boundary ambiguity, I want navigation bars with diagnostic reference images (especially for "uncertain" or "suspected edema" criteria) to improve borderline case accuracy.  

18. As a mobile user, I want all buttons and input areas optimized for one-handed operation to facilitate concurrent patient care or device handling.  

19. As an optometrist requiring case reviews, I want timestamped records of every step selection to support:  
   - Quality control and medico-legal review  
   - Team training  
   - Product optimization (e.g., identifying prolonged/frequent step transitions to improve UI/UX and clinical efficiency)
