1. As an optometrist, I want the system to display diagnostic pathways clearly without requiring internet, so that I can rely on it in community clinics or remote practice settings.

2. As an optometrist, I want the tool to highlight "red flag" symptoms (e.g., sudden vision loss, severe headache), so that I know when immediate referral is mandatory.

3. As an optometrist, I want to return to previous steps in the decision guide, so that I can review or modify inputs if needed.

4. As an optometrist, I want explanations of professional terms (e.g., PHOMS, drusen), so that I can make informed decisions even with unfamiliar findings.

5. As an optometrist, I want the system to retain partially completed questionnaires, so that I can resume work after interruptions.

6. As an optometrist with age-related or impaired vision, I want adjustable font sizes, so that I can read content comfortably.

7. As an optometrist (first-time user), I want a clear tutorial, so that I can quickly understand the workflow.

8. As an optometrist (experienced user), I want the option to skip tutorials, so that I can access the tool faster.

9. As an optometrist, I want a minimalist and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on clinical judgment without distractions.

10. As an optometrist, I want to export referral summaries as PDFs, so that I have documentation for referral forms.

11. As an optometrist, I want color-coded urgency tags (red/yellow/green) on patient assessments, so that I can prioritize reviews efficiently.

12. As an optometrist, I want a submission confirmation prompt, so that I know when a diagnostic workflow is complete.

13. As an optometrist (junior), I want simplified referral explanations, so that I can better communicate with patients and improve compliance.

14. As an optometrist (novice), I want an "Exit Test" button, so that I can restart if I make accidental inputs.

15. As an optometrist, I want to save and exit assessments anytime, so that I can manage my schedule flexibly.

16. As an optometrist (mobile user), I want a dark/eye-care mode, so that I can work comfortably in low-light environments.

17. As an optometrist, I want reference images for unclear diagnoses (e.g., optic disc edema), so that I can improve accuracy in borderline cases.

18. As an optometrist (mobile user), I want one-handed operation support, so that I can use the tool while handling patients or equipment.

19. As an optometrist, I want timestamped step-by-step logs, so that I can:
   - Support quality control and audits.
   - Train team members.
   - Identify UI/UX improvements (e.g., steps causing delays).
