*The acceptance criteria primarily focus on verifiability, functional completeness, edge case error handling, and UI/UX considerations*


### user story 1


**As an optometrist,<br>
I want the diagnostic pathway to be rendered offline using local data (e.g. JSON structure),<br>
so that I can use the system in remote without internet access.**

| ID  | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                    | Category                        |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| AC1 | The flowchart data (e.g. pathway structure, decision branches) must be fully loaded from a local JSON file, with no network requests required.                         | Verifiability / Offline support |
| AC2 | When the device is offline, users must still be able to open and have a full view of the diagnostic flowchart.                                                         | Edge case / Verifiability       |
| AC3 | The flowchart should render within 3 seconds (this threshold could adjusted based on actual performance testing)                                                       | Functional completeness         |
| AC4 | All flowchart functions must behave identically in offline mode as in online mode.                                                                                     | Functional consistency          |
| AC5 | If the JSON file fails to load, the system must display a clear error message and must not attempt to fetch any data from the internet.                                | Edge case / Error handling      |
| AC6 | The system must not make any requests to external resources (e.g. APIs or CDNs); network activity logs (e.g. browser developer tools) should show no external traffic. | Verifiability                   |

### user story 2

**As an optometrist,<br>
I want the diagnostic conclusion output to align with the content of the clinical guideline, <br>
so that I can make traceable and reliable clinical decisions.**

| ID   | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                | Category                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| AC1  | Each diagnostic conclusion generated by the system must correspond to a specific path or statement found in the official guideline document.                                       | Verifiability                              |
| AC2  | The diagnostic pathway structure used in the system must follow the logical sequence and content of the PDF-based guideline flowchart, and must be manually reviewed for accuracy. | Structural integrity / Manual verification |

### user story 3

**As an optometrist,<br>
I want the system to record my selected option after each evaluation step,<br>
so that I can clearly see the progress of the whole pathway.**

| ID   | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                   | Category                                    |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| AC1  | After each question is completed, the system must save the question and the selected answer in a progress record area (e.g. sidebar or top navigation).                               | Verifiability / Interaction feedback        |
| AC2  | The progress record must display completed questions and their selected answers in a linear order.                                                                                    | Usability / Traceability                    |
| AC3  | The progress information should persist across page refreshes or navigation events.                                                                                                   | Functional completeness / State persistence |
| AC4  | If the user revisits and changes a previous answer, the corresponding question and all subsequent records must be automatically updated or cleared to avoid diagnostic inconsistency. | Logic integrity / Error prevention          |

### user story 4
**As an optometrist,<br>
I want to click and return to any previously answered decision point and modify my answer,<br>
so that I can reassess based on new findings.**

| ID   | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                 | Category                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| AC1  | On every evaluation page, the user should see the decision history of the current path, showing all previously questions and corresponding answers. | Visibility               |
| AC2  | When the user clicks on any completed node, they should be navigated back to that step and allowed to change their answer.                          | Interaction / Navigation |
| AC3  | Once the answer is modified, all subsequent steps after that node must be automatically refreshed to reflect the updated logic.                     | Dynamic update           |
| AC4  | After editing a previous answer, the user should be able to continue the evaluation flow from the updated position.                                 | UX                       |
| AC5  | The current question should be visually highlighted to help the user identify their position in the decision flow.                                  | UI                       |
