### Insteuctions for developing the app
- this app serves for Optometrists, GPs and Patients
- this app helps healthcare providers and patients navigate suspected papilloedema cases, based on the DIPP study guidelines

our goal is...
- to help patients and optometrists decide how they react in different senarios.
- to improve referral accuracy across the healthcare system using the app, reducing unnecessary hospital visits while ensuring true papilloedema cases receive prompt assessment and treatment.

### What this app does for optometrists:
The app guides optometrists through a structured assessment:
- Check their glasses prescription 
- Look for heterophoria or heterotropia (eye alignment problems) 
- See if older patients need reading glasses 
- Examine the fundus for disc swelling, cotton wool spots, or hemorrhages 

The checklist system categorizes symptoms:
- **RED FLAGS** mean immediate A&E referral 
- **URGENT PROBLEMS** need referral within 1-2 weeks 
- **COMMON HEADACHES** can go back to their GP 
- **OPTOMETRIC HEADACHES** can be treated with prescription updates 

### What this app does for patients:
A separate patient version helps individuals with headaches decide:
- When to do nothing 
- When to see their GP 
- When to see an optometrist 
- When to go straight to hospital 
It explains what patients can expect if they have red flag symptoms:
They may see emergency clinicians, neurologists, or ophthalmologists...

High importance of mentioning if they have **known pseudo-papilloedema.**

### Extensions:
We acknowledges GPs' different expertise levels, so we're not expecting them to diagnose pseudo-papilloedema, but GPs should be able to recognize definite swelling or normal discs. 
For Hospital Specialists, there could be more additional versions available. e.g. It defines how to triage referrals and access urgency for ophthamologists, specifies specific guidlines for practice of neurologists, and offer support for non-specialists in A&E for emergency clinicians.
