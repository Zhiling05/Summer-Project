#### Pathway 4 · Eye Findings That Positively Identify Pseudopapilloedema but May Need Referral

 **If any of the following conditions apply, urgent referral to Ophthalmology is required.**

------

#### Q1: Is there evidence of buried optic disc drusen?

- On fundus examination, do you observe features suggestive of **optic disc drusen**, especially **buried types** that may not be visible on the surface (e.g., localized elevation with autofluorescence or hyperreflectivity)?
- **Yes** → Recommend urgent referral
- **No / Uncertain** → Proceed to the next question

------

####  Q2: Is PHOMS suspected, but OCT is not available to confirm?

- Are there signs such as **blurred disc margins**, **disc elevation**, or **increased reflectivity** that are **suggestive of PHOMS** (Peripapillary Hyperreflective Ovoid Mass-Like Structures), but **you do not have access to OCT** imaging to confirm?
- **Yes** → Recommend urgent referral
- **No / PHOMS ruled out with OCT** → Proceed to the next question

------

####  Q3: Has the patient with pseudopapilloedema shown changes in visual acuity or visual fields?

- Even if the disc appearance suggests pseudopapilloedema, has the patient reported or demonstrated:
  - A **decrease in visual acuity** (e.g., blurred or reduced vision)?
  - **New visual field defects**, such as scotomas or constriction, during visual field testing?
- **Yes** → Recommend urgent referral
- **No** → Routine follow-up or further observation as appropriate

------

###  Referral Instructions

1. **Attach supporting documentation:**
   - Please include **optic disc photos and/or OCT images** with the referral form (digital or printed copy).
2. **Imaging triage recommendation:**
   - If available, the patient’s images should be **triaged by an Ophthalmologist within 1 week** of referral.
3. **Otherwise:**
   - Follow the **standard triage process** to determine whether an outpatient ophthalmology appointment is required.
