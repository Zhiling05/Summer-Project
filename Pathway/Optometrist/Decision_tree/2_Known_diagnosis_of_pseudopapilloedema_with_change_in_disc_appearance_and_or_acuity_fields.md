## Known diagnosis of pseudopapilloedema + change in disc appearance and/or acuity/fields


---
Identify possible patient visit scenarios:
- Asymptomatic routine vision examination
- With headache but no red flag symptoms
- With visual symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., transient blurred vision, diplopia)
- With headache red flag symptoms




### Q1: Is there *optic disc swelling* observed during the examination?
*optic disc swelling: cotton wool spots, flame haemorrhages, peripapillary folds etc.*
- Yes *(switch to pathway that identifies papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema)*
- No *( : Q2 )*

### Q2: Does the patient have a known diagnosis of pseudopapilloedema documented in HES records, OCT imaging reports, or previous clinic notes etc.?
- Yes *(: Q3 )*
- No *(switch to pathway that identifies papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema)*

### Q3: Compared to previous photos or OCT records, is there any *change in disc appearance and/or acuity/fields*?
*For example, do patients got increased swelling, new obscuration, or drop in acuity/fields compared to documented baseline etc.*

- Yes **(urgent referral to ophthalmology, include baseline images and OCT if available)**
- No *(No treatment required, considered stable pseudopapilloedema....Ensure regular monitoring if necessary)*
