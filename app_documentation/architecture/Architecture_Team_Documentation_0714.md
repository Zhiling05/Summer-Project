## Architecture Team Documentation

### Project Setup

1. Pull the `docs` folder from the develop branch to your own branch

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout your-branch-name
   git checkout origin/develop -- docs/
   ```

2. Open the project with VSCode and open the terminal

3. Run the command: `npm install` to download all dependencies

4. Run the command: `npm run dev`to verify the installation. If you can see:

   - Terminal displays "Local: http://localhost:5173"
   - Browser can open the project normally
   - No error messages
   - You can see the Logo Page title

   Then you can start development! ðŸ‘¾
