## Architecture Team Documentation

### Project Setup

1. Pull the `docs` folder from the develop branch to your own branch

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout your-branch-name
   git checkout origin/develop -- docs/
   ```

2. Open the project with VSCode and open the terminal

3. Run the command: `npm install` to download all dependencies

4. Run the command: `npm run dev`to verify the installation. If you can see:

   - Terminal displays "Local: http://localhost:5173"
   - Browser can open the project normally
   - No error messages
   - You can see the Logo Page title

   Then you can start development! ðŸ‘¾



### Current Routing Structure

```
src
 |-- App.tsx (Main routing, includes logo page + user role selection page + path entry for each role's App)
 |__ types
      |__ assessment.ts (Interface for 19 questions variables, please strictly follow this specification for future development)
      |__ recommendations.ts  (Interface for 6 referral result variables, same as above)
 |__ pages
      |__ LogoPage.tsx (Logo display page when entering the app)
      |__ UserSelectionPage.tsx  (Home page for each user role's App, extracted separately as it's common)
      |__ gp
      |__ patient
      |__ optometrist
           |__ OptometristApp.tsx (Manages all routes under optometrist version)
           |__ Guide.tsx (Can be ignored for now, considering guide may contain multiple jump pages, will be moved to guide folder after functionality is confirmed)
           |__ Records.tsx (Records page may only need one page, can consider developing directly on this basis)
           |__ assess
                 |__ AssessRouter.tsx (Main routing for assessment, manages all routes under assess)
                 |__ StartPage.tsx 
                 |__ questions
                       |__ QuestionsRouter.tsx (Manages all question routes)
                       |__ Q1.tsx
                       |__ Q2.tsx
                       |__ ...(Q3-Q19)
                 |__ recommendations
                       |__ RecommendationsRouter.tsx (Manages all result routes)
                       |__ ...(6 types of result route .tsx files)
```



### Future Development

1. You can add page components in the corresponding `.tsx` files for each page, and create corresponding CSS files, or develop style systems, such as:

   ```
   src/styles/
      |__ globals.css         # Global styles
      |__ variables.css       # Variables
      |__ themes.css          # Themes
      ...
   ```

2. Optionally develop shared components
