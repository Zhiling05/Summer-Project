Patient with Headache Symptoms but No Signs of Raised Intracranial Pressure
1. Determine Whether the Patient Has a Headache
Question 1: Does the patient currently have a headache?

A. Yes → Proceed to Step 2.

B. No → Do not proceed to further evaluation. Provide routine feedback or return advice.

2. Determine Whether the Patient Has Any Signs of Raised Intracranial Pressure
Question 2: Does the patient exhibit any symptoms indicative of raised intracranial pressure? (e.g., vomiting, blurred vision, diplopia, worsening headache)

A. Yes → Refer to emergency department for further evaluation.

B. No → Proceed to Step 3 to analyze headache characteristics.

3. Analyze the Characteristics of the Headache
Question 3: What is the nature of the headache? (e.g., persistent, intermittent, sudden onset, or gradually worsening?)

A. Intermittent or cyclical → Proceed to Step 4 for further evaluation.

B. Persistent or gradually worsening → Further inquiry regarding other systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight change, appetite change) is required. If present, consider other potential causes and further evaluation.

4. Is the Headache Related to Refractive Errors?
Question 4: Does the patient have refractive errors (e.g., nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism)?

A. Yes → Has the patient corrected it or been wearing corrective lenses?

A1. Yes → Continue to evaluate for possible eye fatigue, as this might be optometric headache (e.g., caused by prolonged screen use or near-vision tasks).

A2. No → Recommend an eye exam to check if refractive error is contributing to the headache.

B. No refractive error → Continue to the next step.

5. Is the Headache Associated with Visual Tasks?
Question 5: Does the headache correlate with extended visual tasks (e.g., prolonged reading or screen time)?

A. Yes → This might be optometric headache. Recommend rest for the eyes or the use of corrective lenses.

B. No association → Proceed to Step 6.

6. Are There Any Other Associated Symptoms?
Question 6: Does the headache also present with any other visual symptoms (e.g., dry eyes, blurred vision, frequent blinking)?

A. Yes → This may be optometric headache. Recommend a full eye check-up.

B. No other symptoms → Proceed to further evaluation for other potential causes.

7. Are There Any Specific Triggers or Relief Factors?
Question 7: Is the headache associated with specific activities (e.g., exercise, eating, emotional fluctuations)?

A. Yes → Document any associated triggers. Evaluate if it's related to lifestyle or non-cranial issues.

B. No specific triggers → If the headache lacks a clear cause, recommend observation or consider other potential diagnoses.

Referral Recommendations:
If refractive error or eye fatigue is the cause of the headache, refer the patient to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for further evaluation.

If the cause of the headache is unclear and is not related to vision, suggest a referral to a general practitioner or neurologist for further checks and to rule out other potential conditions.
