# 2.6 The patient shows signs of increased intracranial pressure
---

## 1. Visual symptoms suggestive of raised intracranial pressure

**Q1. Have you experienced episodes of transient visual obscuration (blurred vision, blackout, grey-out)?**

□ Yes  □ No

**Q2. How long do these obscurations last and what triggers them (e.g. coughing, bending, posture change)?**

□ < 5 s  □ 5–30 s  □ > 30 s
□ Triggered by posture/Valsalva  □ No clear trigger

**Q3. Do you have double vision (diplopia)?**

□ Yes  □ No

*If Yes*

Q3.1 Is it in one eye or both eyes? □ One  □ Both
Q3.2 Does it disappear when one eye is closed? □ Yes  □ No
Q3.3 Is it worse in a particular gaze direction? □ Yes  □ No  □ Not sure

**Q4. Has your best-corrected visual acuity dropped by ≥ 2 chart lines?**

□ Yes  □ No  □ Unknown

**Q5. Are you aware of a new visual-field defect (e.g. missing or grey patches)?**

□ Yes  □ No  □ Unsure

## 2. Headache and systemic history

**Q6. Have you recently experienced headaches?**

□ Yes  □ No

*If Yes*

Q6.1 Onset and pattern □ Acute □ Chronic (> 2 weeks) □ Intermittent □ Constant □ Worsening □ Stable

Q6.2 Associated features (tick all) □ Nausea □ Vomiting □ Photophobia □ Phonophobia □ None

Q6.3 Red-flag features (tick all)

□ Worst on waking or early morning
□ Pulsatile tinnitus
□ Altered consciousness
□ Seizures
□ Thunderclap onset (peak < 5 min)
□ Progressive with fever
□ Focal neurological deficit (weakness, speech difficulty)

**Q7. Have you started or stopped any drug that affects intracranial pressure (e.g. corticosteroid, vitamin A analogue)?**

□ Yes  □ No  □ Unknown

**Q8. Relevant systemic or neurological disease (tick all that apply)**

□ Hypertension □ Hyperthyroidism □ Autoimmune disease □ Past brain tumour/trauma/surgery □ None □ Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## 3. Fundus and imaging findings

**Q9. Cotton-wool spots on or near the optic disc**

□ Yes  □ No

**Q10. Flame or blot haemorrhages on or near the disc**

□ Yes  □ No

**Q11. Other disc signs (tick all)**

□ Obscuration of vessels
□ Disc hyperaemia
□ Peripapillary retinal folds
□ Choroidal folds
□ Obvious disc swelling ≥ 2 disc diameters
□ None of the above

**Q12. OCT shows diffuse RNFL thickening**

□ Yes  □ No  □ OCT not done
*(Global RNFL > 100 µm or increase > 30 µm from baseline suggests oedema)*

**Q13. Features of pseudopapilloedema (tick all)**

□ Drusen □ Crowded disc □ Tilted disc □ PHOMS on OCT □ None

**Q14. Known history of pseudopapilloedema**

□ Yes  □ No

*If Yes*

Q14.1 Recent change in disc appearance, vision or field □ Yes □ No □ Not available

## 4. Action and referral pathway

### 4.1 Immediate emergency referral (same-day Eye Emergency or ED)

* Any of Q9 or Q10 = Yes
* Any sign in Q11 = Yes
* Visible disc swelling ≥ 2 disc diameters even without haemorrhage
* Best-corrected visual acuity reduced by ≥ 2 lines (Q4 = Yes)
* New visual-field defect (Q5 = Yes)
* Any red-flag headache feature in Q6.3
* Rapidly progressive symptoms of intracranial pressure

### 4.2 Urgent referral within 48 hours (neuro-ophthalmology or joint clinic)

* New-onset diplopia or transient visual obscurations (Q1 or Q3 = Yes) **with** normal or equivocal discs
* Pseudopapilloedema with new change (Q13 = Yes **and** Q14.1 = Yes)

### 4.3 Urgent referral within 1 week (“suspected papilloedema” pathway)

* Q9 and Q10 = No **but** any suspicious disc sign in Q11

  * Upload OCT/disc photographs for remote triage within 1 week
  * If imaging upload impossible, send patient for face-to-face review within 1 week

### 4.4 Routine follow-up (community eye care 3–6 months)

* Q9/Q10 = No **and** Q13 = Yes **and** Q14.1 = No
* Monitoring schedule: repeat vision, visual field and OCT at locally agreed 3–6 month interval

### 4.5 No referral required

* Q9/Q10 = No, Q13 = No, normal vision and field, and headache lacks red-flag features
* Manage primary headache (e.g. migraine) via GP pathway
