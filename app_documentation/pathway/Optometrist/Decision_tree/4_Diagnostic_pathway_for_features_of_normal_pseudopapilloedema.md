**2.4 Diagnostic pathway for features of normal pseudopapilloedema**

---

**Q1：Is there any optic disc swelling observed during the examination?**
**(e.g. cotton wool spots, flame haemorrhages, peripapillary folds)**
- yes (switch to pathway that identifies papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema)
- No ( : Q2 )
  

**Q2: Are there features suggestive of pseudopapilloedema based on optic disc anatomy?**
**(e.g. crowded optic disc, tilted disc, obvious white-yellow bodies within the optic disc, PHOMS on OCT)**
- yes (：Q3 ）
- No (Switch to pathway for uncertain swelling origin) )


**Q3: Is there any change in acuity or visual field？**
- yes (Consider referral for further ophthalmological evaluation）
- No (Normal, no referral required)

_Option A of Q1 may be misleading, so I'll explain it logically:_

_Possible points of doubt:_

 _If Q1 = Yes (optic disc swelling is observed), why do we switch to a pathway that identifies both papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema? Shouldn’t we go directly to diagnosing true papilloedema?_

 
_Answer:_

_Seeing optic disc swelling doesn’t always mean the patient has true papilloedema. Some structural variants— such as optic disc drusen, PHOMS, or tilted discs—can mimic swelling on examination or imaging. That’s why a "Yes" answer to Q1 means the patient needs a more detailed evaluation to check for red flag symptoms (like headache or nausea), OCT support, and any visual changes. This helps distinguish whether the swelling is truly pathological or just a harmless anatomical variation._
