## Sprint1 Review

| **Section**             | **Details** |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Purpose**             | To inspect the product increment and collect feedback from the client and supervisor. |
| **Focus**               | Focused on the product features and deliverables completed during this Sprint. |
| **Attendees**           | Development team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Supervisor, Medical Advisor |

| **When It Happens**     |2025/06/27 |
| **Duration**            | Approximately 2 hours |
| **What Is Discussed**   | - Presentation of completed work (prototype and logic diagrams)  <br> - Client and supervisor feedback on decision tree logic  <br>  - Clarification of contract responsibility and signature flow |
| **Key Question**        | “Does the product meet client expectations? What adjustments are needed in the decision tree and UI prototype?” |
| **Goal**                | To collect feedback from the client and supervisor, assess whether the decision tree logic and UI prototype meet expectations, and revise future development accordingly. |
| **Artifacts or Tools**  | - GitHub  <br> - Lark  <br> - Xmind  <br> - Google Docs  <br> - Notion  <br> - Miro  <br> - Figma |
| **Example Questions Asked** | - What value did we deliver to the client in this Sprint?  <br> - Do the supervisor and client approve of our logic and structure design?  <br> - What aspects require revision and improvement? |


## Sprint1 Achievements

- Successfully implemented the first version of the optometrist diagnostic decision tree logic.  
- Completed the initial interactive UI prototype; client gave positive feedback.  
- Submitted the university license agreement for approval.  

## Areas for Improvement

- Logic pathways for some questions remain unclear; trigger conditions and combination rules need clarification.  
- Inconsistent color coding in the flowchart; recommend using a traffic light system (red/orange/green) with a legend.   

##  Next Steps

- Client and supervisor will provide an updated logic specification document by this Friday.  
- The team will revise the decision tree structure and deliver an updated interactive prototype based on feedback.  
- Supervisor will assist in driving the license agreement signing process.
